# Udacity-PopularMovies-2stPart

My work for the Part 2 of PopularMovies for the Udacity Android NanoDegree

Put your TheMovieDatabase API key in Strings.xml and MovieDetailsActivity.java files.

- fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- allow users to view and play trailers (in the youtube app).
- allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
